# udemy-linux-device-drivers

This is the basic information for code in the Udemy Linux Device Drivers course. I'm keeping
my larger set of notes in another document.

One of the first issues I ran into was that some of the information was to come from an earlier class from this teacher.
Since I didn't take that course, I had to surf the web a little to learn how to compile/link the basic module. This is
the *kernel-modules-web*.
